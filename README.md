# 🇰🇪 Kenyan Stock Analyzer — NSE Daily Dashboard

A fully automated daily stock analysis pipeline for the **Nairobi Securities Exchange (NSE)**. Fetches data from **TradingView** (100% accurate, no guesses), performs technical and fundamental analysis on all 57+ listed stocks, and generates an interactive HTML dashboard with individual stock reports.

## Features

- **All 57 NSE stocks** analyzed daily — not just a watchlist
- **Fundamental analysis** — P/E, PEG, ROE, ROIC, operating/net margins, debt ratios, revenue/EPS growth, market cap, and more
- **Technical analysis** — RSI, MACD, Bollinger Bands, SMA/EMA crossovers, Stochastic, ATR, OBV, support/resistance levels
- **6 charts per stock** — price+SMA+Bollinger, RSI, MACD, volume, stochastic, ATR
- **Plain-English explanations** — every metric explained in simple terms (e.g. "RSI above 70 = overbought, price may pull back")
- **Similar stocks** — peer comparison by sector, market cap, and valuation
- **Sector performance** — sector-by-sector breakdown with average returns
- **Market breadth** — advance/decline, % above SMA50, bullish MACD ratio
- **Excel export** — multi-sheet workbook with all data
- **Clean runs** — old reports and cache files are automatically removed each run

## Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.10+
- macOS or Linux (Windows works but PDF generation requires extra setup)

### 1. Set up

```bash
cd kenyan_stock_analyzer
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 2. Configure (optional)

```bash
cp .env.example .env
# Edit .env if you want email notifications or custom settings
```

### 3. Run

```bash
./run.sh
```

This generates:
- `reports/index.html` — **main dashboard** (open this in your browser)
- `reports/SCOM_report_*.html` — individual stock reports (57 files)
- `reports/nse_analysis_*.xlsx` — Excel export
- `reports/market_summary_*.html` — market summary

### 4. Open the dashboard

```bash
open reports/index.html
```

## Usage

### Daily run (recommended)

```bash
./run.sh
```

### Command-line options

```bash
python main.py                    # All stocks, 6-month data, HTML only
python main.py --detailed         # Generate individual stock reports (57 files)
python main.py --export-excel     # Also export Excel workbook
python main.py --report-type both # Generate HTML + PDF (requires WeasyPrint)
python main.py --period 1y        # Use 1 year of historical data
python main.py --force-refresh    # Skip cache, fetch fresh data
python main.py --watchlist-only   # Only analyze configured watchlist (10 stocks)
```

### Daily automated run (cron)

Add to your crontab (`crontab -e`):

```cron
# Run at 3:00 PM EAT (market close) on weekdays
0 12 * * 1-5 cd /path/to/kenyan_stock_analyzer && ./venv/bin/python main.py --detailed --export-excel >> logs/cron.log 2>&1
```

Nairobi is UTC+3, so 15:00 EAT = 12:00 UTC.

## Daily Summary Email (automated, cloud-based)

Get a **1-page PDF summary of key metrics emailed to you every weekday at ~10 pm EAT** — automatically, on GitHub's servers, whether or not your computer is on.

The summary is a subset of the dashboard (the dashboard itself is unchanged) and includes:
- Market pulse — bullish/bearish counts, breadth, USD/KES
- **Data quality** — how many prices were independently verified vs flagged as mismatched/stale
- Your watchlist — TV signal (Buy/Sell), price, change, yield, score
- Top gainers/losers
- **Upcoming ex-dividends** (next 30 days)
- Key alerts (strong Buy/Sell, oversold, high yield, etc.)

### How it works

- `send_summary.py` runs a lean pipeline (data → analysis → fundamentals → price validation → scoring), builds the PDF via `ReportGenerator.generate_summary`, and emails it.
- `.github/workflows/daily-summary.yml` runs `send_summary.py` on **GitHub Actions** at `19:00 UTC` (22:00 EAT), Monday–Friday, plus a manual "Run workflow" button.
- **Nothing is stored on GitHub.** Each run starts on a fresh, empty machine, generates the report, emails it, and is then discarded. No PDF/HTML is uploaded as an artifact or committed to the repo (`reports/`, `data/`, `*.pdf`, `*.xlsx` are git-ignored), so files never accumulate and no storage is consumed.

### Setup (one time)

1. Create a Gmail **App Password** at <https://myaccount.google.com/apppasswords> (requires 2-Step Verification). Do **not** use your normal password.
2. In your GitHub repo, add three **Actions secrets** — *Settings → Secrets and variables → Actions → New repository secret*:

   | Secret name | What it holds |
   |-------------|----------------|
   | `EMAIL_USER` | the Gmail address that sends the report |
   | `EMAIL_PASSWORD` | the 16-character Gmail **app password** |
   | `EMAIL_RECIPIENTS` | comma-separated recipient address(es) |

   > 🔒 **Keep these in GitHub Actions secrets only.** Never commit real credentials to the code, the README, or a tracked `.env`. (`.env` is git-ignored.)

### Run it manually

- **Web:** repo → **Actions** → *Daily NSE Summary Email* → **Run workflow** → branch `main` → **Run**.
- **CLI:** `gh workflow run "Daily NSE Summary Email"` then `gh run watch`.

### Run / test locally

Put `EMAIL_USER`, `EMAIL_PASSWORD`, and `EMAIL_RECIPIENTS` in your **local `.env`** (git-ignored), then:

```bash
ENABLE_EMAIL_NOTIFICATIONS=true python send_summary.py --force-refresh
```

With email disabled it just builds `reports/nse_summary_*.pdf` without sending.

> **Notes:** GitHub's scheduler can start a few minutes late — harmless for a daily digest. Running at 10 pm means the market is closed, so prices reflect the settled daily close. Check your spam folder for the first email and mark it "not spam".

|-----------|--------|--------|
| OHLCV price history | TradingView | `tvkit` WebSocket API |
| Fundamental metrics | TradingView | Scanner API (Kenya market) |
| Daily price list (fallback) | NSE PDF | OCR via `pdf2image` + `pytesseract` |
| Historical data (fallback) | Yahoo Finance | `yfinance` |

## Requirements

```
tvkit>=1.0.0
yfinance>=0.2.0
pandas>=2.0
numpy>=1.24
matplotlib>=3.7
seaborn>=0.12
jinja2>=3.1
python-dotenv>=1.0
requests>=2.31
beautifulsoup4>=4.12
openpyxl>=3.1
certifi>=2023.0
pytesseract>=0.3
pdf2image>=1.16
weasyprint>=60.0    # Optional: for PDF output
schedule>=1.2       # Optional: for scheduler
```

### System dependencies (macOS)

```bash
# For PDF generation (WeasyPrint)
brew install pango glib

# For NSE PDF OCR (optical character recognition)
brew install tesseract poppler
```

## Troubleshooting

### WeasyPrint (PDF) not working on macOS
```bash
brew install pango glib
```

### Yahoo Finance timeout
Yahoo Finance can be unreliable for NSE stocks. The pipeline tries multiple sources:
1. TradingView (primary — most reliable)
2. NSE PDF (current-day prices via OCR)
3. Yahoo Finance (historical data, multiple ticker formats)

### Email not sending
- Gmail: Use an [App Password](https://myaccount.google.com/apppasswords), not your regular password
- Ensure `SMTP_HOST`, `SMTP_PORT`, `EMAIL_USER`, and `EMAIL_PASSWORD` are set in `.env`
