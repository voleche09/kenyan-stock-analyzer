    "market_cap": (
        "Market Capitalisation — the total value of all the company's shares "
        "added together. It tells you how big the company is. Think of it as "
        "the price tag to buy the entire company."
    ),
    "pe_ratio": (
        "Price-to-Earnings (P/E) — how many shillings you pay for every "
        "1 shilling of profit the company makes. A high P/E (e.g. 30+) means "
        "investors expect fast growth. A low P/E (e.g. <10) may mean the "
        "stock is cheap or the company has problems. Always compare P/E to "
        "other companies in the same sector."
    ),
    "peg_ratio": (
        "Price/Earnings to Growth (PEG) — P/E divided by the earnings growth "
        "rate. This adjusts the P/E to account for how fast the company is "
        "growing. PEG < 1.0 suggests the stock may be undervalued relative "
        "to its growth. PEG > 1.0 suggests it may be overvalued."
    ),
    "eps": (
        "Earnings Per Share (EPS) — the company's profit divided by the "
        "number of shares. Higher EPS means the company is making more "
        "money per share you own. This is the 'E' in P/E ratio."
    ),
    "eps_growth": (
        "EPS Growth (Year-over-Year) — how much earnings per share have "
        "grown compared to the same period last year. Positive growth means "
        "the company is becoming more profitable. 10%+ is solid; 20%+ is "
        "excellent. Negative growth is a warning sign."
    ),
    "revenue_growth": (
        "Revenue Growth (Year-over-Year) — how much total sales have grown "
        "compared to last year. Revenue is the 'top line' — money coming in "
        "before any costs. Growing revenue means the business is expanding. "
        "Falling revenue may mean losing market share."
    ),
    "gross_margin": (
        "Gross Margin — the percentage of revenue left after paying for the "
        "direct costs of making the product or service. Higher is better. "
        "A 50% gross margin means for every 100 KES in sales, 50 KES is "
        "left after direct costs to cover other expenses."
    ),
    "operating_margin": (
        "Operating Margin — the percentage of revenue left after paying both "
        "direct costs AND operating expenses (salaries, rent, marketing, "
        "etc.). This shows how profitable the core business is. Higher = "
        "more efficient operations."
    ),
    "net_margin": (
        "Net Profit Margin — the percentage of revenue that becomes actual "
        "profit after ALL costs, taxes, and interest. This is the 'bottom "
        "line.' A 20% net margin means 20 KES of every 100 KES in sales "
        "becomes profit."
    ),
    "roe": (
        "Return on Equity (ROE) — how much profit the company generates "
        "with the money shareholders have invested. ROE of 15% means the "
        "company makes 15 KES in profit for every 100 KES of shareholder "
        "equity. 15-20% is generally good. Above 20% is excellent but "
        "check if it is sustainable."
    ),
    "roic": (
        "Return on Invested Capital (ROIC) — how efficiently the company "
        "uses ALL the money invested in it (both from shareholders and "
        "lenders) to generate profit. Higher than the company's cost of "
        "capital means it is creating value. ROIC > 15% is strong."
    ),
    "debt_to_equity": (
        "Debt-to-Equity (D/E) — compares what the company owes (debt) to "
        "what shareholders own (equity). A D/E of 1.0 means debt equals "
        "equity. Below 0.5 is conservative (low risk). Above 2.0 is "
        "aggressive (high risk). Banks naturally have higher ratios."
    ),
    "current_ratio": (
        "Current Ratio — measures if the company can pay its short-term "
        "bills (due within 1 year) using its short-term assets. Above 1.0 "
        "means they can cover their bills. Below 1.0 is a red flag. "
        "Too high (>3) may mean idle cash not being invested."
    ),
    "free_cash_flow": (
        "Free Cash Flow (FCF) — the actual cash the business generates "
        "after paying for buildings, equipment, and other capital needs. "
        "This is the money available to pay dividends, buy back shares, "
        "or invest in growth. Positive FCF is healthy."
    ),
    "dividend_yield": (
        "Dividend Yield — the annual dividend payment as a percentage of "
        "the current share price. A 5% yield means you get 5 KES per year "
        "for every 100 KES invested. High yields are attractive but check "
        "if the dividend is sustainable."
    ),
    "rsi": (
        "Relative Strength Index (RSI) — a momentum indicator from 0-100 "
        "that measures how fast and how much the price is moving. Above 70 "
        "= 'overbought' (price may have risen too fast and could pull "
        "back). Below 30 = 'oversold' (price may have fallen too fast and "
        "could bounce). Between 30-70 is neutral territory."
    ),
    "recommendation": (
        "Analyst Recommendation — the average rating from analysts covering "
        "the stock, on a scale of 1 (Strong Buy) to 5 (Strong Sell). "
        "1.0-1.5 = Strong Buy, 1.5-2.5 = Buy, 2.5-3.5 = Hold, "
